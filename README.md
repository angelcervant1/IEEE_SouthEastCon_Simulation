# IEEE_SouthEastCon_Simulation

This repository contains a comprehensive simulation environment designed for the IEEE SoutheastCon 2025 Hardware Competition. Built with ROS 2 and Docker, it enables teams to develop, test, and validate autonomous robot behaviors in a virtual replica of the competition stage.â€‹


## Features
- ROS 2 Integration: Leverages ROS 2 for modular development and real-time robot control.

- Dockerized Setup: Ensures a consistent and portable development environment across different systems.

- Simulation Environment: Provides a virtual stage that mirrors the actual competition layout for accurate testing.

- Modular Architecture: Facilitates easy customization and extension of robot functionalities.
